OK, so I'm finally taking a [compilers
course](https://www.coursera.org/course/compilers), which is something I
couldn't do while I was at university, because it was always at the same time
than some other mandatory course for me. When my schedule finally allowed, I
started working and ended up not attending university that semester, so I never
completed the course.

Well, I'm still not sure about finishing this particular course, since the
workload seems to be significant for somebody with a full-time job, violin
lessons and a Teaching Assistanship once a week, not to mention other books I'm
currently reading, especially my new favorite: [A Song of Ice and
Fire](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Story-Continues-Swords-ebook/dp/B0050AV5MW/).
