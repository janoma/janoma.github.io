Dear `boost::disjoint_sets`: I hate you. Or not.

I *do* like you, I have to say, and *also* dislike you. You would be more
useful if your documentation was a bit more clear, or if every example out there
was not a copy of one of the two examples found in
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4134703/understanding-boostdisjoint-sets).

Well, a little less conversation and a little more action. *If* I manage to
understand enough, I will add some example here.
