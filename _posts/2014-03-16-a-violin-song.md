I'm currently learning violin. The song I have to study is a minuet by Luigi
Boccherini, which is the last theme of the second book of the [Suzuki
method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_method).

I wish I could produce a sound half as good as [this
guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_EY6xwYRjU), or a recognizable
vibrato. Well, time will tell.
